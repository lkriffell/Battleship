### Gameplay

(Taken from Wikipedia) Battleship is a strategy type guessing game for two players. It is played on ruled grids on which each player's fleet of ships (including battleships) are marked. The locations of the fleets are concealed from the other player. Players alternate turns calling "shots" at the other player's ships, and the objective of the game is to destroy the opposing player's fleet.

Our version allows you to create your own board size and place your two ships onto the board. The player is given a submarine (2x1) and a cruiser (3x1) as their ships. They must be placed consecutively and on valid points on the grid. The player will choose a coordinate to fire onto the enemy (computer) and will result in a miss or a hit. Once a coordinate has been fired on, it cannot be fired upon again. The computer relies on a semi-intelligent firing system where once it hits part of your ship will attempt to fire on the rest of it nearby.
